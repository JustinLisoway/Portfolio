I co-authored a study on the mobile accessibility challenges faced by mobile app developers on android and iOS devices. We mined and processed thousands of Stack Overflow posts to help answer 3 research questions. The bulk of this study took place over 4 months, and we are still working on getting the final paper published. I have provided our abstract and method figures below.

Abstract:

This study explores the accessibility design challenges faced by mobile developers by analyzing Stack Overflow posts related to the accessibility design of Android and iOS applications. The investigation focuses on three key aspects: factors influencing the growth of mobile accessibility questions, characteristics of such questions, and the challenges inherent in mobile accessibility development. The methods of this study involve exploring the growth in mobile accessibility questions through a per-year analysis, and various statistical measures are employed to delineate their characteristics. Topic modeling techniques, specifically Latent Dirichlet Allocation, were utilized to identify developersâ€™ challenges. Findings revealed a substantial increase in accessibility questions in the early 2010s, potentially attributed to the introduction of laws and regulations, alongside the emergence of new accessibility features like voiceover and talkback. Furthermore, data analysis indicates that accessibility questions typically receive responses within two days and tend to outnumber corresponding answers. Additionally, integrating new accessibility features into mobile applications, particularly in user interface design and the quest for practical solutions to mobile accessibility issues, was identified as a core challenge mobile developers encounter.

- RQ1: What are the attributes related to the growth of mobile accessibility questions?
- RQ2: What are the characteristics of mobile accessibility questions?
- RQ3: What are the challenges associated with mobile accessibility development?
