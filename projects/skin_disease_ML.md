summary: "I collected and preprocessed thousands of images sourced from DermNet of 23 skin diseases, then fine tuned a CNN (convolutional neural network) model to classify any image of a skin condition into 1 of 23 given categories. The model acheived 40% accuracy on the test data."

As part of my data science class, I collected and preprocessed thousands of images sourced from DermNet of 23 skin diseases, then fine tuned a CNN (convolutional neural network) model to classify any image of a skin condition into 1 of 23 given categories. The final model acheived 40% accuracy on the test data.
